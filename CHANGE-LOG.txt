1.2
 * Upgraded Windows build to Zlib 1.2.1
 * Added vncpasswd to the build
 * Fixed bug where snapshot thought it had got a non-blank screen when
   in fact it hadn't (bug resulted in blank screen captures)
1.1
 * Included UltraVNC RFB definitions in header files. UltraVNC encodings
   and scalings are not supported yet, however.
 * Merged Tight VNC 1.2.8 and RealVNC 3.3.7 sources
 * Merged Tight VNC 1.2.7 sources
 * When saving a sub-area of the server's screen, only that part is fetched
   (formerly the entire screen was fetched)
 * New '-ignoreblank' and '-allowblank' to work around RealVNC servers that
   send an initial blank screen.
 * Now supports '-cursor' and '-nocursor' options; unfortunately these only
   work for recent TightVNC servers
 * Merged RealVNC 3.3.6 sources
 * Now supports both TightVNC 'tight' and 'zlib' encodings and RealVNC
   'zrle' encoding.
 * Dropped beta status as I got no bug reports (in fact, no reports at all)
 * -tunnel and -via options now supported for all platforms (not tested on Windows)
 * Fix: coordinates of -0 (0 pixels from right/bottom edge) now work
 * Win32 Release build works
1.0 Beta 2
 * Added manual page
 * Updated zlib dependancy to version without security vunerability
 * Updated web page to include author's e-mail
 * Updated BUILD.unix and BUILD.win32 to point to official JPEG and zlib sites
